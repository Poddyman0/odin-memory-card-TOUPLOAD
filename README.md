Project Title: Memory Game
Description:
For this project, I built a Memory game using React. The game involves matching pairs of cards, and it includes a scoreboard to track the current score and the best score achieved. The cards' images and texts are fetched from an external API, making the game dynamic and engaging.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and managing state with hooks.
CSS: For styling the application.
External API: For fetching images and text for the cards.
Features:

Game Mechanics:

Card Matching: The game involves cards that need to be matched by flipping them. When a user clicks on a card, it reveals its content. If two flipped cards match, they remain visible; otherwise, they flip back.
Score Tracking: A scoreboard displays the current score, which increases with each successful match.
Best Score: The highest score achieved during gameplay is tracked and displayed as the “Best Score.”
Card Management:

Randomization: Cards are displayed in a random order each time the game is started or the component is mounted.
Card Data: Card images and texts are fetched from an external API. Options include using Giphy for animated images or a Pokémon API for themed images.
Components and Structure:

App Component: Manages the overall game logic and state, including score management and card shuffling.
Card Component: Represents individual cards, handles click events, and displays the card content.
Scoreboard Component: Displays the current score and best score.
API Service: Handles fetching card data from an external API.
Styling:

Visual Appeal: The application is styled to provide a visually engaging user experience. This includes card designs, layout, and overall game aesthetics.
Deployment:

The project is pushed to GitHub and deployed to a hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
Implementation Steps:

Set Up React Project:

Created a new React project using Create React App.
Design Application Structure:

Planned the components and folder structure. Decided on components for the game logic (App), individual cards (Card), and the scoreboard (Scoreboard).
Fetch Data from API:

Implemented an API service to fetch card images and text. Chose an API based on the desired theme (e.g., Giphy or Pokémon).
Implement Game Features:

Created the card matching logic and integrated it with React hooks for managing state.
Added functions to shuffle and display cards randomly.
Styling:

Applied CSS to style the cards, scoreboard, and overall game layout.
Push to GitHub and Deploy:

Committed the code to GitHub and deployed the application to Vercel or Netlify for online access.
